Saving SuperStore

I have been hired as a consultant to review the superstore's operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy. For each numbered question in this project, I will produce a separate visualization.

Part 1: Profits & Losses
I will analyze important centers of profits and losses for the Superstore using different dimensions. Visualizations will be used to identify the two biggest profit centers and the two biggest loss-makers.
To determine which products the superstore should stop selling, I will create visualizations to justify the decision based on profitability and sales performance.
For product subcategories, I will focus on three subcategories that show potential for growth and stop selling three subcategories with poor performance, supported by visual evidence.

Part 2: Advertising
To assess the effectiveness of advertising, I will identify the three best combinations of states and months to advertise. Using visualizations, I will showcase the average profit per month for those states and determine the maximum budget for advertising based on a return on ad spend ratio.

Part 3: Returned Items
By creating calculated fields to represent returns and using visualizations, I will identify products and customers with the highest return rates. Additionally, I will present an argument for keeping or discontinuing business based on the average profit and return rate for a selected dimension.

Part 4: Submitting The Project
I will extract and prepare the data locally for my Tableau dashboard. After building and publishing the dashboard on Tableau Public, I will compress all relevant files, including the data file and dashboard link, into a ZIP archive and submit it for review.
